# Welcome to my homepage!

### 1. Introduction
My name is Qiyao (pronounced chi-yao), and I am currently a second-year PhD student at Cambridge. My research focuses on AI/ML, and I am a PhD student in the department of mathematics (CMS/DAMTP). This means I have a strong interest in AI for Math, but also other topics as well, e.g. finance, medicine, etc.

### 3. Research Projects
Please find some suggestions for research projects in this folder. I have written down these research projects because I identify with them, I know they qualify for a top ML conference (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR) if carried out properly, but unfortunately I cannot kakebunshin and therefore do not have the time to complete them all.
