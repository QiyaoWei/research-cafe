### Project details:
We need help on a paper to submit to Neurips 2025 (deadline May 15th) "A Graph-Enhanced Attention Encoder-Decoder LLM for Code Vulnerability Repair Using GitHub Commit Data". The paper is about 60% written, the code is also written.  More tests need to be done, and results need to be improved.
