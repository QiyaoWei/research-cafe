### Project details:
1. American Kompromat: The Influence of Foreign Powers on U.S. Leadership

Description: This project explores whether foreign powers, particularly Russia and China, have compromised U.S. political figures and major donors. It would analyze intelligence reports, financial ties, and geopolitical strategies used by adversarial states to influence U.S. policy. Case studies could include past allegations involving Trump, Biden, or major campaign donors.

2. EU Strategic Autonomy: Building a Credit Deterrent Against Russia

Description: This project investigates how the EU can reduce its financial dependence on the U.S. while establishing a credit deterrent against Russia. It could analyze the feasibility of an EU financial system independent of U.S. sanctions mechanisms (e.g., alternatives to SWIFT, the role of the euro in energy markets, and EU-wide investment in security and infrastructure).

3. AGI and the Future of Global Tech Policy

Description: This project examines how different global powers—such as the U.S., China, and the EU—are shaping policies around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It could explore regulatory approaches, national security concerns, and the ethical implications of superintelligent AI, comparing strategies like the EU AI Act, U.S. executive orders, and China’s tech regulations.

4. The UK’s Role in the US-EU Relationship under Trump 2.0

Description: If Trump is re-elected, what role should the UK play between the U.S. and EU? This project would analyze the pros and cons of UK foreign policy under a second Trump administration, focusing on trade, security, and diplomatic alignment. It could also explore the potential for UK-EU reconciliation or divergence in response to shifting U.S. priorities.

5. The Rise of the American Oligarchy and Its Impact on Global Politics

Description: This project investigates how America’s wealthiest elites shape both domestic and international order. It could examine campaign finance, lobbying, and foreign policy decisions driven by billionaires (e.g., Musk, Bezos, Thiel, and Koch networks). The study could contrast this with historical oligarchies and assess their impact on democracy and international relations.
