New Sampling methods for Extreme Value Theory

In statistics, scholarship thus far has largely focused on modeling values that fall within the typical range of the data, with extreme values of the dataset left as an afterthought. However, when modeling temperature, statistical extremes provide insight into specific weather phenomena where extreme values indicate cold snaps or heat waves. Similarly, when modeling rain, extreme values denote floods. It is crucial that we can model these extreme events.

Previous attempts at modeling these weather events have employed Extreme value theory. However, due to the complex nature of the (posterior) distribution, they have relied on simple random walk Monte Carlo methods to sample from it. In this project, we will focus on spatial extreme value theory, using new Monte Carlo methods to model extreme rain events across the UK. 

At the end of this project, the student will learn the theory behind spatial extreme value theory as well as modern sampling techniques, including interacting particle and adaptive methods.
